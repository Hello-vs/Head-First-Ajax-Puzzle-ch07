Modified a bit of the logic to utilize objects for the key-value pair for dictionary lookups.

I modified O'Reilly Head First Ajax ch07 t0 woggle-puzzle-test.html and Script: woggle-test.js

In ch07 I created a dictionary like object to index the frequencey the letter will appear on the puzzle board.  I dynamically
created a table to hold the list of repeated letters according to their frequencey of appearance on the puzzle board.

woggle-test.js does not make server calls to PHP programs included in this chapter 7.
